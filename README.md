# Note-Taker


## Description
This is a simple note-taking application for storing thoughts, lists, and reminders. The user is able to title their notes and compose body text that is as short or as long as they need. When a new note is filled out, the user then clicks the Save button in the upper right corner, and the note is added to the note list on the left side. If the user wishes to delete a note, they may do so by clicking the trash can icon next to the note they wish to delete. The application will store notes and reload them if the page is exited and returned to later, so all notes the user has created will be saved and available until they choose to delete them.
